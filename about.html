			<h1>A Little Bit About Me...</h1>
			<p>Hi there! My name is Sabria Islam, and I'm from Queens, NY. When I was 14 years old, I came out as queer to my friends, which was a difficult and complicated journey for me. As someone who was raised in a Muslim family, I struggled with reconciling my sexuality with my faith, and it took me a long time to come to terms with who I am.</p>
			<p>Nonetheless, I've found solace in my identity by making friends with other queer Muslims. Finding that sense of community was integral in accepting and understanding who I am, and it's given me the strength to help others who are struggling with similar challenges.</p>
			<p>Growing up in a diverse place like NYC, I have been lucky enough to meet other people like me. However, I understand the hardships and danger it is for queer muslims in predominantly heterosexual spaces to feel accepted. I believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to live their lives authentically and be proud of who they are. Through <i>LGBTQ Muslims Unite</i>, I hope to help others feel less alone and more empowered in their own journeys. </p>
